# CourtFinder

In this project, I made this which is part of the final project of the campus at my university. I hope this project can have an efficient impact on finding a food court place along with tenants and food lists. and can also make it easier for tenants to make orders from customers and can print order notes. This project has a transaction report from tenants that can be seen by the food court manager
