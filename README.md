# CourtFinder

CourtFinder is a project developed as part of my final university project. The goal of this application is to provide an efficient solution for users to find food courts, tenants, and food lists with ease. It also simplifies the process for tenants to manage customer orders and print order receipts. Additionally, the project includes a transaction reporting system that allows food court managers to view reports from tenants, providing a comprehensive view of operations.
